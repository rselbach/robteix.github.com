  <div class="entry-content"><p>After three decades, the Space Shuttle is finally retired.  Check out the video below for a bit of history.  I thought the video so well done!  In a little over 8 minutes it gives you a feeling of how much happened already.  Also, stop to think about this for a minute: 30 FUCKING YEARS.</p>

<p>Most nations who tried to launch payloads into space failed miserably and still haven&#8217;t achieved it. And yet, THIRTY years ago the Shuttle started operation.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next? NASA is now helping private enterprises develop the capability to fly people to the ISS so it can buy flights commercially. How long will it take? No one knows. And none of the companies is working on anything like the shuttle, so the future for now looks like it&#8217;s going to be on heavy-rockets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been spending an insalubrious amount of time on <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google +</a>. I managed to plump for a pretty good group to follow and as a consequence I&#8217;ve been getting consistently interesting content. As for myself, I mostly I post in English. A couple of days ago, I posted something most inconsequential and it would have been an unreservedly unremarkable post wasn&#8217;t it for the fact that it was geolocated in Cordoba, Argentina, which caused it to attract the attention of people nearby. In the middle of the comments, someone asked, in Spanish: &#8221;<em>why is everyone speaking English?</em>&#8221; That was a fair question and it touched something that has bugged me in the past.</p>

<p>Some part of my brain must miss the good old times of hunting and gathering as I ended up as a nomadic man—albeit one who doesn&#8217;t hunt and at most gathers food from grocery stores, so there might be a flaw in my theory. My rootless nature made me move a lot. This and the nature of my work caused me to make friends in several places other than my native Brazil[1].</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already established that I communicate in Portuguese. Working at a US-based multinational as well as with open source, I also use English quite a bit—and my aforesaid rootlessness has taken me to inhabit the beautiful state of Oregon in the past. Oh and did I mention I am currently putting in a tour of duty in Argentina?</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1653&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;The Myth of the Tower of Babel&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasthomas/274884308/"><img src="http://robteix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/274884308_8a9b319c87_z-300x226.jpg" alt="The Myth of the Tower of Babel" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The result of all of this—<a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-330951.html">in blatant contrast with the pre-Tower of Babel times when everybody obviously spoke English</a>—is that I communicate daily in multiple languages. There isn&#8217;t a day—well, weekday—I don&#8217;t have to speak Spanish, Portuguese, English and French with someone or another. And that is fine and actually quite nice: you do lose languages if you don&#8217;t use them. Not like riding a bike, I suppose. Regardless, it is not a problem to communicate 1:1 in those languages. But what about 1:many conversations?</p>

<p>Blogging is a clear example. Should I blog in Portuguese as some keep telling me I should? I cannot reasonably expect my non-Brazilian readers to understand Portuguese. If I write in French, my Quebecer friends will be happy but what about the rest? Nationalistic rants aside, English <em>is</em> an international language nowadays, just as Latin and French once were. Aside from <em>very</em> few people, the vast majority of the people I know can understand English and that&#8217;s why I use it most often than any other.</p>

<p>Ideally, one would use their own native language and computer translation would do the rest. Unfortunately we are not there yet. I will admit that computer translation is getting better and better and it is fairly good if you write clear, short sentences. And it will get better. But I am skeptic that we will ever get to the point where the algorithms will be able to deal with subtleties, innuendos and all the puns that make up human interactions.</p>

<p>The way I see, I currently have a few options –</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I write in Portuguese, as the ever vigilant Brazilian crowd demands it. </strong>That would soothe the wrathful nationalists who believe me a Traitor Of The Fatherland™. But it also limits my already limited audience; not good.<strong>
</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>I write multiple versions of the same thing in each language. </strong>That would begin to feel like actual work, not fun. Also, having tried that in the past, I&#8217;ve learned that after I was done with the first version, the others never came out naturally.<strong>
</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>I write in English. </strong>Sure it makes me a bootlicking lackey of the imperialist Yankees in the eyes of the insecure, but it also helps me reach pretty much everyone I know.<strong>
</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p>But using English is not a perfect solution either. For once, I am obviously not a native speaker and thus have an imperfect and narrow vocabulary. As well, I don&#8217;t share the cultural experiences that help define the subtleties of English. And finally, there are heaps of topics that just <em>feel wrong</em> in English: such as local—as in Brazilian—topics. It just feels weird.</p>

<p>Back to Google+, I have created Circles for Portuguese and French, but these are not much valuable until Google comes up with some system of set arithmetic that would allow me to say something to the effect of &#8220;Post this to members of Circle X who also happen to be members of Circle French.&#8221; Until then, English is my best bet.</p>

<p>[1] Experience tells me that I am required to point out that we, cheerful Brazilians, speak Portuguese, not Spanish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve got many gripes with the internet, I’ll admit. One of those is the overuse of Godwin’s Law. Actually, it’s a double offence because not only people overuse it, but this Law is anything but.</p>

<p>But let’s start with the misuse. I posted a while ago to Facebook that I had finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451651686/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1451651686&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=itsuptoyoma-20">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a> and I mentioned how scary it was that a place right in the heart of “civilized” Europe could have fallen to that madness so quickly. A small discussion formed with some people until one of my geek friends commented something to the effect of—</p>

<blockquote><p>  Let’s stop this because Roberto already Godwinned in the original post!</p></blockquote>

<p>You see, us geeks are good at that: repeating some meme without thinking much about them.</p>

<p>But that’s how I see “Godwin” being used all over the place. A discussion killer. And the discussion did get killed, unfortunately. It’s like Godwin’s Law says “if someone mentions Nazis, the discussion is over” but that’s not what the “law” says—</p>

<blockquote><p>  As an online discussion continues, the probability of a reference or comparison to Hitler or to Nazis approaches 1.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is actually true. Just like—</p>

<blockquote><p>  As an online discussion continues, the probability of a reference or comparison to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves approaches 1.</p></blockquote>

<p>Obviously, as a discussion grows, the probability of referencing <em>anything</em> will approach 1! Here’s Godwin himself back in 2008 about his “law”—</p>

<blockquote><p>  Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of mathematics, its purpose has always been rhetorical and pedagogical: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler or to Nazis to think a bit harder about the Holocaust.</p></blockquote>

<p>I find it ironic that his little experiment for making people think harder about the Holocaust is now used as a tool to <em>avoid</em> mentions to it.</p>

<p>You see, I get where Godwin was trying to go. You see glib comparisons with the Nazi all the time and yes, they suck. But going from that to making one of the most defining moments of the last Century completely off-limits is preposterous! Nazi comparisons are often valid and should <em>not</em> be avoided, especially by misusing an old usenet meme.</p>

<p>Again, His Godwinness—</p>

<blockquote><p>  Still, I sometimes have some ambivalence about the Law, which is far beyond my control these days. Like most parents, I’m frequently startled by the unexpected turn my 18-year-old offspring takes. […] When I saw the photographs from Abu Ghraib, for example, I understood instantly the connection between the humiliations inflicted there and the ones the Nazis imposed upon death camp inmates—but I am the one person in the world least able to draw attention to that valid comparison.</p></blockquote>

<p>Avoiding comparing things to something as defining as Nazi Germany is an arbitrary limitation that makes no sense.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that all Nazi comparisons are valid. There really are plenty of dishonest Nazi comparisons out there, such as <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/news/Governor-says-IRS-new-gestapo-in-radio-address.html">this one</a>, by an American governor—</p>

<blockquote><p>  We the people have been told there is no choice. You must buy health insurance or pay the new Gestapo &#8211; the IRS.</p></blockquote>

<p>This because the Supreme Court of the United States had upheld a law that represented the first steps of that country in <strong>following</strong> the rest of the civilized world in providing its citizens with basic healthcare. <em>Healthcare! Oh the evils of that Gestapo!</em></p>

<p>But it’s unreasonable to expect people to <em>completely</em> ignore a huge part of our history in hope that dishonest governors won’t make silly comparisons, which they’ll do anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend I took the family to celebrate Father&#8217;s Day away from town. We went around getting to know parts of the province we live in and never been to.</p>

<p><a href="http://robteix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0402.jpg"><img src="http://robteix.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0402-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a>We came back yesterday and the plan today was for a nice, calm day at home (it&#8217;s a holiday of some sort here.) Then I got engaged in a game called <strong>Hanging with Friends</strong>, a mix of the traditional hangman with a bit of Scrabble.</p>

<p>Since English isn&#8217;t my first language, I have a limited vocabulary, which leaves me at a disadvantage against my English-speaking friends. I can handle the &#8220;hangman&#8221; part of the game where I have to guess the word my friends come up with; but when it becomes &#8220;Scrabble&#8221; and I&#8217;ve got to form words using only a given set of letters and still make them difficult enough that a native English speaker will have problems figuring them out, then it&#8217;s tough.</p>

<p>An itch that needed some scratching. Enter <a href="http://robteix.com/w/Anagramizer">Anagramizer</a>.</p>

<p>When I woke up this morning, I decided to write a little program to help me. You call it cheating, I call it having a bit of nerd fun.</p>

<p>Being that I&#8217;m currently in love with <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, I decided to write in that language and it was really easy and quick to do it. It took me about half an hour to write the program that did what I needed. But then&#8230;</p>

<p>I succumbed to the temptation and started adding bells and whistles. Admittedly it was mostly for my own amusement and trying stuff in Go, but by the time we were leaving for lunch, the program had more options than the KDE audio volume utility (see what I did just there?)</p>

<p>I decided to <a href="http://robteix.com/w/Anagramizer">make it available to anyone</a> who wants to play with it. It served its purpose of entertaining me for about half a day :)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now available on <a href="https://github.com/robteix/anagramizer">Github</a> and released under a BSD licence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was surprising to me. For fun I picked one of the Euler algorithms I played with in the past and rewrote it in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>. The idea was to rewrite it idiomatically to see how different things might look. Nothing else. The very first thing I did was to get the exact algorithm and rewrite, no idiomatic changes.</p>

<pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func isTriplet(a, b, c int) bool {
        return a * a + b * b == c * c
}

func main() {
        for a := 1; a &lt; 1000; a++ {
                for b := a + 1; b &lt; (1000 - a) / 2; b++ {
                        c := 1000 - a - b
                        if isTriplet(a, b, c) {
                                fmt.Println(a * b * c)
                                return
                        }
                }
        }

}
</code></pre>

<p>What surprised me is that this thing runs in 0.005s, which is faster than <a href="http://robteix.com/2010/08/03/euler-9/">the Python implementation</a> and very close to <a href="http://robteix.com/2010/08/04/euler-9-in-c/">the one in C</a>. It surprised me because this wasn&#8217;t really supposed to happen. The Go compiler isn&#8217;t well optimized, especially compared to compilers with a many-years headstart.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just so I have it documented somewhere for future reference, here&#8217;s how to quickly set <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> up on Windows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download it from <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Unzip it to, say, C:\emacs or something like that</p></li>
<li><p>Set the environment variable HOME to C:\emacs and include C:\emacs\bin to the PATH</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to have a &#8221;<strong>Open with _G_NU Emacs</strong>&#8221; option on the context menu, just create a registry file (call it emacs.reg or whatever.reg) with the contents below and double-click it to import it into the registry.</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\emacsmenu\command]

(require 'color-theme)
(color-theme-initialize)
(when (display-graphic-p)
  (color-theme-subtle-hacker)
