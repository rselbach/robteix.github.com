<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://ohitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/527279_436801283051213_1826357756_n-580x500.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>According to everyone on the Internet, George Lucas is selling Lucasfilm and other businesses—including the revered Industrial Light &amp; Magic—to the evil mouse that is The Walt Disney Company.</p>

<p>But what is really setting the Internet on fire is a comment from the <a href="http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-news/press-releases/2012/10/disney-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>  In 2015, we&#8217;re planning to release Star Wars Episode 7 – the first feature film under the &#8220;Disney-Lucasfilm&#8221; brand. That will be followed by Episodes 8 and 9 – and our long term plan is to release a new Star Wars feature film every two to three years.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so I decided to chime in to say why I think this is <em>awesome</em> news. To understand why, you need to understand just a little bit of the history of Star Wars.</p>

<p>Back in the early 1970s, George Lucas decided to create a science-fiction epic. He had touched the genre with THX1138 in 1971, but now he wanted something more upbeat. He wanted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNIVpMXHqlk">Flash Gordon</a>.</p>

<p>George Lucas sat and tried to write a screenplay but was ultimately unsuccessful, settling for an outline instead. And it ended up a copy of Akira Kurozawa’s <em>The Hidden Fortress</em>, as can be seen by comparing both the film’s and Lucas’ synopses (from <a href="http://hem.bredband.net/wookiee/development/">The development of Star Wars</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>  <em>The Star Wars:</em></p></blockquote>

<p>  “It is the thirty-third century, a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A rebel princess, with her family, her retainers, and the clan treasure, is being pursued. If they can cross territory controlled by the Empire and reach a friendly planet, they will be saved. The Sovereign knows this, and posts a reward for the capture of the princess.”8</p>

<p>  <em>The Hidden Fortress:</em></p>

<p>  “It is the sixteenth century, a period of civil wars. A princess, with her family, her retainers, and the clan treasure is being pursued. If they can cross enemy territory and reach a friendly province they will be saved. The enemy knows this and posts a reward for the capture of the princess.</p>

<p>The screenplay eventually evolved into the very different story we are all familiar with. His dialogue was still terrible even after he got some help. It was so bad, in fact, that actor Harrison Ford famously threatened to tie Lucas down and force him to read his own dialogue. But the movie worked. Yes, it was cheesy and yes, there are some pretty serious plot holes, but overall it was a decent movie, innovative enough at the time to draw huge crowds into the movie theaters.</p>

<p>But compared with <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>The Return of the Jedi</em>, it is bad. The reason is that George gave up writing screenplays and let others do that job, resulting in the <em>great</em> and dark <em>The Empire&#8230;</em>. He came back to co-write <em>The Return&#8230;</em> and we got the Ewoks. He would later write <em>Phantom Menace</em> all by himself. and I suppose this speaks by itself. Most of the other films we associate with Lucas were written—and often directed—by someone else. Think <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p>

<p>My point here is, George Lucas cannot write to save his life. <em>He. Is. Terrible.</em></p>

<p>Back to the press release from Disney, here’s Lucas himself:</p>

<blockquote><p>  It&#8217;s now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of filmmakers. I&#8217;ve always believed that Star Wars could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Yes!</em> He is right. It is high time he passed Star Wars to someone more competent. Especially after he managed to create an absolutely <em>horrible</em> prequel trilogy <em>and</em> mess with the originals at the same time. <em>Solo shot first, not Greedo!</em></p>

<p>So yes, passing the torch is a good thing. Sure, Disney is a soulless, conservative corporation known for lobying Mickey Mouse’s copyright ownership rights into infinity. Also, Pooh, a <em>public domain</em> charater taken over. And yes, Disney gave us <em>John Carter</em>. But they also own Pixar, so I give them a little leeway here.</p>

<p>The fact is that whoever Disney gives control of Star Wars to, he or she is unlikely to do worse than the man who brought us the Ewoks, Jar-Jar Binks, and the epic of zoophilia: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6hDf5cCUJw">Howard the Duck</a>.</p>

<p>Unless they cast Justin Bieber as Luke. Oh boy&#8230;</p>
